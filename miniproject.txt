MiniProject Implementation
**************************

1) DataBase

    Ex.
        MongoDB


2) Server

    Ex.
        Node Server


3) Frontend

    Ex.
        Angular with NgRx


DataBase
********
    - MongoDB DataBase is "NoSQL" DataBase.

    - MongoDB DataBase is "JSON" Based DataBase.

    - MongoDB DataBase Supports "mongodb" protocol.

    - MongoDB DataBase by default running on port number "27017".

    - MongoDB DataBase supports the cloud Environment in the form of a "MongoDB Atlas".


Cloud URL : https://account.mongodb.com/account/login

DataBase Details
****************
DataBase Name : ngrx-7am

Collection Name : products

Password : admin

Connection URL : mongodb+srv://admin:admin@miniprojectdb.nzphu.mongodb.net/ngrx-7am?retryWrites=true&w=majority


Server
******
                                ---- Node Server ----

    - NodeJS is "Backend" Technology.

    - NodeJS, used to implement the "Servers".

    - we will build "NodeJS" Applications with the help of "JavaScript".

    - NodeJS Supports the "Modules".

    - we will download "Node Modules" with the help of either "npm" tool, or "yarn" tool.

    - "npm" stands for "Node Packaging Manager".

    - "npm" present in "NodeJS".

    - we will install yarn tool by using following command.

        > npm install -g yarn


modules in NodeJS
*****************

1) mongodb

    - mongodb module used to connect to the mongodb DataBase.

2) express

    - express module used to develop the "rest api's"

    Ex.
        GET
        POST
        PUT
        DELETE
        ---
        ---
        ---
3) cors

    - used to enable the "ports" communication.

    - also called as enabling the "cors policy"


> yarn add express mongodb cors

server.js
*********

start the server
****************

> cd miniproject-server

> node server


test the rest api's by using Postman
*************************************

=> http://localhost:8080/fetch   (GET)

=> http://localhost:8080/insert  (POST)

=> http://localhost:8080/update  (PUT)

=> http://localhost:8080/delete  (DELETE)



Integration of Rest API calls to Angular Application with NgRx Package
**********************************************************************
    Angular Applications are Component Based Applications.

    As a Angular Developer, we can create more than one Component.

    As a Angular Developer, we can provide communication between components.

    providing the communication between components are difficult while incresing the complexity.

    maintaining the "store" at client side called as state management.

    because of state management, automatically application complexity reduces.
